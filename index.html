        <p>A person has a distinguishing characteristic or personal trait that's thought to be, or may be actually is, a disadvantage (a negative stereotype). When this is viewed in a negative way, it is stigma Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common. </p>
        <p>
        The worst consequence is discrimination. Discrimination might be obvious and worst when it is direct, like making a negative remark about the mental illness or the treatment. It can be unintentional or subtle - someone avoiding you because the person assumes you could be unstable, violent or dangerous due to your mental illness. The worst end result can be disastrous when the person gets influenced and starts judging himself. This doesn’t help at all – instead deteriorate the situation. </p>
        <p>The other harmful effects are – not limited to – the concerned person gets reluctant to seek help or treatment, lack of understanding by family, friends, co-workers or others, in some cases lead to bullying, physical violence or verbal harassment. The worst possible disheartening consequence is, the belief that the person builds up that he or she will never succeed at certain challenges or can’t improve the situation – which results in demotivating mindset.  </p>
        <p>Stigma doesn't just come from others always – it can be you, who is harming yourself unknowingly. Don’t start believing that your condition is a sign of your weakness or don’t be under the wrong impression that you can handle it yourself without any help. Don’t isolate yourself – that doesn’t help. Talk. Talk. Talk. You are not an illness. Don’t say “I am bipolar” or “I am schizophrenic” - instead say “I have bipolar” or similarly “I have schizophrenia” So speak out please. There is help somewhere waiting for you. </p>
        <p>Others' judgments almost always stem from a lack of understanding rather than information based on facts. Learning to accept your condition and recognize what you need to do to treat it, seeking support, and helping educate others can make a big difference </p>

        <p>Selecting the wrong answer on a test is a mistake; not studying for that test is a bad decision. The mistake was something you did without intention; the bad decision was made intentionally—often without regard for the consequence.  </p>
        <p>Whether mistake or bad decision (which one knows as “bad decision”, once the outcome is seen), a person has to live with its consequences till the end of life, live with its memories, live with it as a lifelong companion. Why can’t we forget? We can't forget because of the existence of its consequences, which we have to deal with, in each of the turns we take in our life. It's like a shadow to us – we don’t see it once we take a turn, may be because the building right on the side of the path, is blocking the sun – but as you take steps forward, at one time the boundary of the building will end and there – the sun is out again and also your shadow.  </p><p>So, mistake or bad decision) goes with you. Some might think it in this way – ok, the other person has forgiven me, so it’s no more a mistake – I can forget about it. But is it true? Did the other person really forget about it? Did your school remove the bad grades from your transcript – the bad grades that you got for your bad choice for not studying? This will haunt you forever and that’s why you have to survive with your mistakes, bad decision – whatever you call it. The worst part is, the person sees mostly in every instance in his life, being connected to that “once done” mistake of his and he blames himself for no reason. No words can assure him that - “It’s ok to forget and forgive”. Is this what we call repentance? </p><p>Come out of it - let not one instance in life, spoil the rest of the life - our present, our future. We have only one life to enjoy.</p>

        Let passion drive you out of the area where you are stuck with depression, or troubles - which might not have solution right away. Instead of wasting time on that, let's just change our focus to some hobby, passion or other things of interest. Differenet people ahve different way of venting out. For example, this person has a passion for drawing. She spends hours in her own world, drawing whatever she wants. </p>

        <p>Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).</p>

<p>When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.</p>

<p>Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.</p>

<p>Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy)....<em>Mayo Clinic</em></p>

        <p>No one gets everything right 100% of the time. But let’s be a bit more observant and start noticing pattern’s about people’s behavior - and this can have a major impact on one’s life. The more attention we pay, the more we can surround ourselves with people who truly enrich our lives.</p>

<p>Say for example, someone talking about how they made a bunch of money with their latest business venture, and then the listener days something like this “Oh, now you have to pay a lot in self-employment tax. Make sure you save up”. It’s time to ask my self, is the listeners intention is to help out, cherish the other person’s success - or to throw a bit of shade. This is a vive which one should try to stay off from.</p>

<p>Children have a strong sense of determining vive, because they have not developed the sense of reasoning. They don’t understand what adults say or their opinions - but they narrow in on adults’ facial expressions and the way they carry theirselves. That’s where adults’ positive or negative vibes come into play.</p>

Most of the physical objects you spent so much money on when you were younger, hit a landfill years ago. But you still remember the concerts you went to, the vacations you took, and the festivals you attended like they were yesterday. Those memories and the way you felt when you were creating them are as shiny and precious to you today as they were back then. So are the ways some of those experiences, changed you as a person. </p> <p>These days, I never think back on the past and regret not buying some trendy piece of clothing that I probably wouldn’t even have worn or yet another statue to sit on my bookshelf collecting dust. </p> <p>It’s not always obvious when you’re creating one that’s going to mean a lot to you one day. Everyone knows their wedding day or the day their child is born is a big deal and that they’ll remember that for the rest of their life.

        <p>I read a lot of studies and reports where it says that we listen to downbeat songs to remember happier times, and to feel some semblance of the past. The survey also found that listening to a mellow song is better for the brain, especially when dealing with complex emotions, compared to blasting something upbeat. We all enjoy a bit of sad music every once in a while.</p>
        <p>But I don't feel it in that way. It always worked the other way - good, loud and fast music always helped me to come out of that depressing mood. I needed it and helped me. Let me give an example - trust me - I tried it and it works fabulously for me. When I am very sad and down and I am driving all by myself on the highway, I listen to the following song (nevermind about the words - just listen to the rythm). In minutes I am so happy and I notice I am tapping my fingers and shaking my head - and everybody knows when this happens.</p>

<p>But still studies will say that sad music is best for depressed mood. Sad music is a powerful trigger for nostalgic memories of foregone times. Such reflective revisiting of nostalgic memories may enhance mood, especially if the memories are related to pivotal and meaningful moments in life. We enjoy the sweetness of these memories through vivid imaginations. There is some felt in recollecting the good times, as well as sadness from missing them.</p>
